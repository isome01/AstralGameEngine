# Xioudown
This is an online backup state for the Xioudown Game Engine

This game-engine makes use of dependencies:
 - MinGW 64 compiler
 - SDL_development_lib 32/64 bit
 - SDL_image 32/64 bit
 - SDL_ttf 32/64 bit

MinGW 64 compiler is needed to make applications with the Xioudown Game Engine and it currently
DOES NOT compile with libraries 32-bit or lower. It's therefore recommended to just have the
minimal dependencies that Xioudown compiles with (and any other third-party libraries you may be
using) installed before compiling.

link to download mingw64 is https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/

Enjoy :D
